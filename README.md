# 📘 TimeScope — VS Code Time Tracking & Analytics

TimeScope is a lightweight, developer-friendly time-tracking extension for Visual Studio Code.  
It helps you track work sessions, analyze your productivity, and review your day with a clean, interactive dashboard.

Whether you're billing clients, tracking personal projects, or simply curious about where your time goes, TimeScope gives you clarity without getting in your way.

## 🚀 Features

Track time for any job with four intuitive commands:

- Start a job  
- Pause when you step away  
- Resume when you return  
- Stop to finalize the session  

TimeScope automatically builds accurate sessions from your event history.

### 📊 Interactive Summary Dashboard

Explore your work visually with:

- Pie chart of time per job  
- Stacked bar chart of time per day  
- Raw session table with timestamps and tasks  
- Date presets (Today, This Week, Last 7 Days, This Month, Last 3 Months)  
- Job filters with a convenient “All” checkbox  

The dashboard is fast, responsive, and built for real-world workflows.

### 🗂️ Global + Workspace Storage

TimeScope supports:

- Global tracking (across all projects)  
- Workspace tracking (per-project logs)  

You can optionally choose a custom folder for global storage.

---

### 🧹 Automatic Session Reconstruction

TimeScope intelligently rebuilds sessions from your event stream:

- start → stop  
- start → pause → resume → stop  
- Multiple pause/resume cycles  
- Deduplication of mirrored global/workspace events  
- Accurate duration calculation  

No matter how you work, TimeScope keeps your data clean.

## ⚙️ Settings

### Global Storage Directory

```text
timescope.global_storage_dir
```

Choose a folder where TimeScope stores:

- jobs.json  
- logs.jsonl  

If unset, TimeScope uses VS Code’s built-in global storage directory.

---

## 📁 Data Format

TimeScope stores data in a simple, future-proof format.

### jobs.json

Tracks known jobs and metadata.

### logs.jsonl

Each line is a canonical event:

```JSON
{ "event": "start", "job": "Project A", "task": "feature-x", "timestamp": 1704320000000 }
```

The dashboard reconstructs sessions from these events.

### 1. Web-Based Reporting (Exportable HTML Dashboard)

Generate a standalone HTML report that mirrors the in-editor dashboard, including:

This turns TimeScope into a combined time tracker + work journal.
